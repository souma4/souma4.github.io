            <h1> Installing Julia</h1>
            <h2> What is Julia?</h2>
            <p> Julia is a programming language and free software environment
                 for general computing and data science. Julia is designed to be fast,
                    easy to use, and expressive. It is used by data scientists, researchers, and engineers. </p>
                    <p> Note: Julia is a relatively unpopular language because it's trying to fill a niche already filled by
                        popular languages like Python, R, Rust, and C++. However, it is a very powerful language and is worth learning. </p>

                    </p>
                 </p>
            <h2> How to install Julia</h2>
            <p> To install Julia, you will need to go to the Julia website. The website is: <a href = "https://julialang.org/" target = "_blank">julialang.org</a> </p>
                   
                    </p>
                     Once you are on the website, you will need to select the download button and it will autodetect your device.
                     Follow the instructions and install Julia. </p>
                        <h2> Installing VSCode and Julia extension</h2>
                        <p> 
                            To install VSCode, you will need to go to the Visual Studio Code website. The website is: <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/" target = "_blank">code.visualstudio.com</a> </p>
                            Download the version that is appropriate for your operating system, and then install it. </p>
                            
                            <p> Open VSCode, then click on the Extensions tab on the left (looks like blocks). Type in "Julia" into the search bar and install.
                                I will also reccommend installing code runner, which gives better code running capability. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, it is best to set up a keyboard shortcut for "Send Current line or selection to REPL". This gives an easy way to run code from a script in the REPL (terminal).
                                Go to File -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts, and then search for "Send Current line or selection to REPL". Click on the pencil icon and then press the keys you want to use. I use Ctrl+Enter, you may need to rebind "execute code in REPL," which does behave differently.
                            </p>
                             <h2> Opening the REPL </h2>
                            <p> To open the REPL, you will need to open VSCode and a julia (.jl) script, and then press the keys you set up for "Send Current line or selection to REPL". This will open the REPL in the terminal. </p>

    
                                    <h2> Installing Julia packages</h2>
                                    <p> To install Julia packages, you will need to open the REPL and then type in the package manager by typing in the "]" key. 
                                        Then you can type in "add [package name]" to add a package. For example, to add the Plots package, you would type in "add Plots". </p>
                                            
    
                                        <h2> Conclusion</h2>
                                        <p> 
                                            In this lesson you learned how to install Julia, VSCode, and the Julia extension. You also learned how to open the REPL and install Julia packages.
