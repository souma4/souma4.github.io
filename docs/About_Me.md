# Hello all!

- I am Jeffrey Chandler and I'm currently a Masters student at University of Montana studying Systems Ecology.
- I would say I'm a quantitative landscape ecologist that want's to bridge the gaps between forestry, wildlife biology, and disturbance ecology.
- I'm particularly interested in leveraging the full gambit of statistical concepts to analyze ecological relationships over space, notably quasi novel non-parametric methods, ensemble models, and simulation models.
- Currently I'm working on a project that quantifies "holistic" fire-regime departure across western US forested landscapes, and I hope to translate it into broader questions concering the influence of fire exclusion on fire-regime departures and how biodiversity may respond.

# Skills

- I am a proficient programmer in R, Python, and Julia, particularly in spatial analysis, modeling, simulation, and statistics. GitHub page is at [this link](https://github.com/souma4)
- I leverage open source software to the fullest extent.
- Have dabbled in numerous other interfaces such as C, C++, javascript (particularly Google Earth Engine), and ArcGIS (begrudgingly).
- I am also a proficient teacher's assistant/tutor, having been one for 6 different courses.
