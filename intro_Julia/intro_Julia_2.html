            <h1> Lesson 2: Fundamentals of Coding </h1>
            <p> In this lesson, we will learn the basics of coding. </p>
            <p> Coding is the process of creating instructions for a computer to follow. </p>
            <p> These instructions are written in a programming language, such as R. </p>
            <p> Coding is used to create software, websites, and other digital products. </p>
            <p> Coding is an essential skill for anyone interested in technology. </p>
            <p> By the end of this lesson, you will be able to write simple programs in R. </p>
            <p> Let's get started! </p>

            
            <h2> Basic Code </h2>
            <p> In most conding languages, code is written in scripts. </p>
            <p> A script is a series of instructions that tell the computer what to do. </p>
            <p> Each instruction is called a statement. </p>
            <p> Statements are written in a specific order to create a program. </p>
            <p> Here is an example of a simple Julia script: </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <p> # # marks comments </p>
                <p> x = 5 </p>
                <p> y = 10 </p>
                <p> z = x + y </p>
                <p> print(z) </p>
                <p> # Output: 15 </p>
            </div>
            <p> In this script, we assign the the variable x a value of 5. Y is assigned
                10, z is x +y, which is equivalent to 5+10. </p>
            <p> The print function displays the value of z. </p>
            <p> When you run this script, the output will be 15. </p>
            <p> This is a simple example of how code works. </p>
            
            <h2> Math </h2>
            <p> Coding is used to perform mathematical operations. </p>
            <p> Here are some basic math operations in Julia: </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <p> # Addition </p>
                <p> x = 5 + 3 </p>
                <p> print(x) </p>
                <p> # Output: 8 </p>
                <p> # Subtraction </p>
                <p> y = 10 - 2 </p>
                <p> print(y) </p>
                <p> # Output: 8 </p>
                <p> # Multiplication </p>
                <p> z = 4 * 2 </p>
                <p> print(z) </p>
                <p> # Output: 8 </p>
                <p> # Division </p>
                <p> a = 16 / 2 </p>
                <p> print(a) </p>
                <p> # Output: 8 </p>
                <p> # Exponentiation </p>
                <p> b = 2 ^ 3 </p>
                <p> print(b) </p>
                <p> # Output: 8 </p>
                <p> # Modulo/remainder </p>
                <p> b = 15 % 8</p>
                <p> print(b) </p>
                <p> # Output: 7 </p>
            </div>
            <p> with these you can now perform basic math!</p>
            
            <h2> types </h2>
            <p> In coding, there are several types of data that you can work with. </p>
            <p> Here are some of the most common data types in Julia: </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <p> Float32 </p>
                <p> Float64 </p>
                <p> Int8 </p>
                <p> Int16 </p>
                <p> String </p>

            </div>

            <h3> Composite Types</h3>
            <p> Additionally there are composite types, most notably the vector </p>
            <p> A vector is a list of values. Here is an example of a vector in Julia: </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <p> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] </p>
                <p> print(x) </p>
                <p> # Output: 1 2 3 4 5 </p>
            </div>
            <p> These are the basic data types in Julia. </p>
            <p> You will learn more about data types as you progress through the course, and really through your coding career </p>
            
            <h2> while and for loops </h2>
            <p> Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. </p>
            <p> Here are two types of loops in Julia: </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <p> # While loop </p>
                <p> x = 1 </p>
                <p> while x <= 5 { </p>
                <p> print(x) </p>
                <p> x = x + 1 </p>
                <p> } </p>
                <p> # Output: 1 2 3 4 5 </p>
                <p> # For loop </p>
                <p> for i in 1:5 { </p>
                <p> print(i) </p>
                <p> } </p>
                <p> # Output: 1 2 3 4 5 </p>
            </div>
            <p> These loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. </p>
            <p> The while loop repeats the code block as long as the condition is true. </p>
            <p> The for loop repeats the code block for a specific number of times., the 1:5 creates a vector (a list of values) from 1:5. Try it! </p>
            <p> the loop iterates through that list 1:5. so lets try something new</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <p> # For loop </p>
                <p> for i in ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] { </p>
                <p> print(i) </p>
                <p> } </p>
                <p> # Output: apple banana cherry </p>
                </div>
                <p> This loop iterates through the list of fruits and prints each one. </p>
                <p> This is a simple example of how loops work in R. </p>
                
                <h2> map </h2>
                <p> The map function is used to map a function to a matrix, array, or list.
                    This is a powerful tool for working with data structures in Julia. </p>
                <p> Here is an example of how the map function works: </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <p> # Create a matrix </p>
                    <p> x = [1 2 3</p>
                    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4 5 6 </p>
                    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp7 8 9] </p>
                    <p> print(x) </p>
                    <p> # Output: </p>
                    <p> # [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
                    <p> # map the sum function to each column </p>
                    <p> map(t -> t * 2, x) # multiply each element 2</p>
                    <p> # Output:  2   4   6</p>
                        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp8  10  12</p>
                       <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp14  16  18 </p>
                
                    
                </div>

                <h2>Vectorized operations </h2>
                <p> Alternatively you can use vectorized operations to perform operations on matrices, arrays, and lists. </p>
                <p> This uses the "dot syntax" which is where you place a dot before the arguments/function, telling Julia to apply it elementwise</p>
                <p> Here is an example of how vectorized operations work: </p>
                <div class="code-block
                ">
                    <p> # Create a matrix </p>
                    <p> x = [1 2 3</p>
                    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4 5 6 </p>
                    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp7 8 9] </p>
                    <p> print(x) </p>
                    <p> # Output: </p>
                    <p> # [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
                    <p> # Multiply each element by 2 </p>
                    <p> x .* 2 </p>
                    <p> # Output: </p>
                    <p> # [2  4  6</p>
                    <p> #  8 10 12</p>
                    <p> # 14 16 18] </p>
                </div>
                <p>Note: vectorization is treated differently in a lot of languages, and Julia stands out among them, so this skill is somewhat language specific.</p>
                
                <h2> Indexing </h2>
                <p> Indexing is used to access specific elements in a data structure. </p>
                <p> Julia indexes by row first, then column, values starting at 1. (not all languages do this)</p>
                <p> Here are some examples of indexing in R: </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <p> # Create a vector </p>
                    <p> # the `[]` syntax does this</p>
                    <p> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] </p>
                    <p> # Access the first element </p>
                    <p> print(x[1]) </p>
                    <p> # Output: 1 </p>
                    <p> # Access the last element </p>
                    <p> print(x[end]) </p>
                    <p> # Output: 5 </p>
                    <p> # Access multiple elements </p>
                    <p> print(x[[1, 3, 5]]) </p>
                    <p> # Output: 1 3 5 </p>
                    <p> # create a matrix</p>
                    <p> x = [1 4 7;</p>
                    <p>      2 5 8;</p>
                    <p>      3 6 9] </p>
                    <p> print(x) </p>
                    <p> # 1  4  7</p>
                    <p> # 2  5  8</p>
                    <p> # 3  6  9</p>
                    <p> # Access the element in the first row and second column </p>
                    <p> print(x[1, 2]) </p>
                    <p> # Output: 4 </p>
                    <p> # Access the entire second row </p>
                    <p> print(x[2, :]) </p>
                    <p> # Output: 2 5 8 </p>
                    <p> # Access the entire second column </p>
                    <p> print(x[:, 2]) </p>
                    <p> # Output: 4 5 6 </p>

                </div>
                <p> This is a simple example of how indexing works in Julia. </p>
                <p> Indexing is a powerful tool for working with data structures in Julia. </p>
                
                <h2> functions </h2>
                <p> we've already used some functions, but remember functions are the bread and butter
                    of coding as they perform <b>specific</b> tasks given <b>specific</b> inputs </p>
                        <p> We can also create our own custom functions to perform specific tasks</p>
                        <p><i>Try to do this whenenver possible. This will help you build a code base of functions that you can reuse later</i></p>
                <p> Here are some examples of functions in Julia: </p>
                <div class="code-block
                ">
                    <p> # Create a function that adds two numbers </p>
                    <p> add = function(x, y)  </p>
                    <p> return(x + y) </p>
                    <p> end </p>
                    <p> # Call the function </p>
                    <p> print(add(5, 3)) </p>
                    <p> # Output: 8 </p>
                    <p> # Create a function that multiplies two numbers </p>
                    <p> multiply = function(x, y) </p>
                    <p> return(x * y) </p>
                    <p> end </p>
                    <p> # Call the function </p>
                    <p> print(multiply(4, 2)) </p>
                    <p> # Output: 8 </p>
                </div>
                <p> This is a simple example of how functions work in Julia. </p>
                <p> functions are what you will be working with for most of our work. They are the verbs of computer programming</p>
                
                <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                <p> With these tools, you can jump into any programming language. While they all have
                    their quirks, these basic tools will help you get started. </p>
                <p> Remember, coding is a skill that takes time to develop.
                    The best way to learn it is to practice and <b>TRY THINGS</b>. Don't know what a function does? try it with
                a simple case! Don't remember how to do something? google it generally and try out what they say.
            There is always an answer by trying or searching up one, so always remember you can do it! </p>
