            <h1> Installing R</h1>
            <h2> What is R?</h2>
            <p> R is a programming language and free software environment
                 for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation
                  for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians
                   data scientists, and ecologists. Research has also shown that R is rapidly becoming
                   more common, especially in sciences. </p>
            <h2> How to install R</h2>
            <p> To install R, you will need to go to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website.
                    The website is: <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/." target = "_blank">cran.r-project.org</a>
                    </p>
                     Once you are on the website, you will need to select the download link that is appropriate for your operating system.
                      For example, if you are using a Windows operating system, you will need to select the download link for Windows. 
                      Then you select the base link, and then you will need to select "download R-[numbers] for [Operating system]" at the top.

                        <h2> Installing RStudio</h2>
                        <p> RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) 
                            for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting 
                            editor that supports direct code execution, as 
                            well as tools for plotting, history, debugging, 
                            and workspace management. To install RStudio,
                             you will need to go to the RStudio website. 
                             The website is: 
                             <a href = "https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target = "_blank">www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a> </p>

                             <p> Then you will scroll down to "download RStudio Desktop for [Operating system]. Click it, download and install.</p>

                             <h2> Using RStudio</h2>
                                <p> To open RStudio, you will need to go to the start menu, 
                                    and then select RStudio. Once RStudio is open, you will see four panels. 
                                    The top left panel is the script editor (source), where you can write and save your code. 
                                    The bottom left panel is the console(terminal), where you can run your code. 
                                    The top right panel is the environment/history panel, where you can see your variables and history. 
                                    The bottom right panel is the files/plots/packages/help panel, where you can see your files, plots, packages, and help. </p>
                                    <p>Personally, I like having the source panel on the top left and the terminal on the top right, and you make this switch by going to
                                        Tools -> Global Options -> Pane Layout. Acquaint yourself with global options, it is a useful tool
                                        to help you feel more comfortable in RStudio. And an inch of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
                                    </p>
    
                                    <h2> Installing R packages</h2>
                                    <p> R packages are collections of functions and data sets developed by the community. 
                                        They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p> To install packages, you will need to use the install.packages() function in the terminal OR the packages pane on the bottom right. 
                                        For example, to install the tidyverse package, you would use the following code: install.packages("tidyverse") </p>
                                        <p> Once you have installed a package, you will need to load it into your workspace using the library() function. 
                                            For example, to load the tidyverse package, you would use the following code: library(tidyverse).
                                        This must be performed every time you open R, because every time is a fresh slate </p>
                                            
                                            
    
                                        <h2> Conclusion</h2>
                                        <p> In this lesson, we learned what R is, how to install R, how to install RStudio, and how to install R packages. 
                                            In the next lesson, we will learn about the fundamentals of coding in R. </p>
