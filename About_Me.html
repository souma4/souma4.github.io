      <h1>Jeffrey Chandler</h1>
      <h2>Hello All</h2>
     

       <ul>
         <li>
           I am Jeffrey Chandler and I'm currently a Masters student at University
           of Montana studying Systems Ecology.
          </li>
          <li>
            I would say I'm a quantitative landscape ecologist that want's to bridge
            the gaps between forestry, wildlife biology, and disturbance ecology.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm particularly interested in leveraging the full gambit of statistical
            concepts to analyze ecological relationships over space, notably quasi
            novel non-parametric methods, ensemble models, and simulation models.
          </li>
          <li>
            Currently I'm working on a project that quantifies "holistic"
            fire-regime departure across western US forested landscapes, and I hope
            to translate it into broader questions concering the influence of fire
            exclusion on fire-regime departures and how biodiversity may respond.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            I am a proficient programmer in R, Python, and Julia, particularly in
            spatial analysis, modeling, simulation, and statistics.
          </li>
          <li>I leverage open source software to the fullest extent.</li>
          <li>
            Have dabbled in numerous other interfaces such as C, C++, javascript
            (particularly Google Earth Engine), and ArcGIS (begrudgingly).
          </li>
          <li>
            I am also a proficient teacher's assistant/tutor, having been one for 6
            different courses.
          </li>
        </ul>
