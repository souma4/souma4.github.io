# About Me

I'm Jeffrey Chandler. I'm a quantitative landscape ecologist that focuses on how
landscape processes, mostly fire, affects the landscape ecosystem. I am a proficient coder,
coding in R, Julia, Python, and sometimes in C. I don't publish everything to GitHub but
you can see some of my projects at [this location](https://github.com/souma4).
I also love teaching, having been a teachers assistant for 6 classes, and I have developed my own evidence-based
style for helping and informing students, particularly thsoe that are struggling to grasp concepts. Everyone has the capability to succeed,
it's just a matter of adapting to help foster that.
