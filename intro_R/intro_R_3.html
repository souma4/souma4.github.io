            <h1> Fundamentals of R </h1>
            <h2> What is R?</h2>
            <p> R is a programming language and free software environment
                 for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation
                  for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians
                   data scientists, and ecologists. Research has also shown that R is rapidly becoming
                   more common, especially in sciences. </p>
            <h2>Basics of R</h2>
            <p> R uses most of the fundamentals we have already covered, but there are a few R specific things to know</p>
            <h3> Variables</h3>
            <p> In R, you can assign variables using the assignment operator, which is the less than sign followed by a hyphen. For example, if you wanted to assign the value of 5 to the variable x, you would write x <- 5. You can also use the equals sign to assign variables, but it is not recommended. </p>
            <h3> Data Types</h3>
            <p> R has several data types, including numeric, character, logical, and factor. Numeric data types are used for numbers, character data types are used for text, logical data types are used for true/false values, and factor data types are used for categorical data. What
                stands out is that R defaults numbers to numeric and that can actually handle categorical variables</p>
            <h3> Apply </h3>
            <p> Apply is a function in R that allows you to apply a function to a matrix or array. The apply function takes three arguments: the matrix or array, the margin, and the function. The margin argument specifies whether the function should be applied to the rows or columns of the matrix or array. </p>
            <p> We showed how apply worked in the prior section, in short it is faster than looping</p>
            <h3> Data Frames</h3>
            <p> Data frames are a type of object in R that is used to store data in a tabular format. Data frames are similar to matrices, but they can store different types of data in each column. Data frames are commonly used in R for data analysis and data visualization.
                Most other languages do not natively support data frames </p>
            <h3> Lists</h3>
            <p> Lists are a type of object in R that can store multiple objects of different types. Lists are similar to vectors, but they can store different types of objects in the same list. Lists are commonly used in R for data manipulation and data analysis. </p>
            <h3> Statistics</h3>
            <p> R has a wide range of statistical functions that can be used to analyze data. Some of the most commonly used statistical functions in R include mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and correlation. R also has functions for hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and time series analysis. Most other languages require
                you to download a package or force you to manually do this.
            </p>
            <h3> Data Visualization</h3>
            <p> R has a wide range of data visualization functions that can be used to create plots and graphs. Some of the most commonly used data visualization functions in R include plot, hist, boxplot, and scatterplot. R also has functions for creating more advanced plots, such as heatmaps, bar charts, and line graphs. R also has functions for creating interactive plots and 3D plots. </p>
            <h3> Data Manipulation</h3>
            <p> R has a wide range of data manipulation functions that can be used to manipulate data. Some of the most commonly used data manipulation functions in R include subset, merge, and aggregate. R also has functions for reshaping data, transforming data, and cleaning data. R also has functions for creating new variables, recoding variables, and filtering data. </p>
            <h2> Conclusions </h2>
            <p> R is a powerful programming language that is widely used for statistical computing and graphics. R has a wide range of functions that can be used to analyze data, create plots, and manipulate data. R is also free software that is supported by a large community of users and developers. R is a great language to learn if you are interested in data analysis, data visualization, or statistical computing. </p>
