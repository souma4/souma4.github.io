            <h1> Basic Data Manipulation </h1>
            <h2> What is data manipulation?</h2>
            <p> Data manipulation is the process of changing data to make it easier to read or to prepare it for analysis. </p>
            <h2> Why is data manipulation important?</h2>
            <p> Data manipulation is important because it allows you to clean and transform data so that it is in a format that is easier to work with.
                Additionally,  it allows for quick, reliable, and transferable data analysis</p>
            <h2> How to manipulate data in R</h2>
            <p> In R, there are several packages that can be used to manipulate data. Some of the most common packages include dplyr, tidyr, and data.table. 
                These packages allow you to filter, sort, group, and summarize data. </p>
                <p> we will use "tidyverse" which loads a suite of useful data wrangling packages, such as dplyr and tidyr</p>
                <p> To install the tidyverse package, you will need to run the following code in RStudio: </p>
                <div class = "code-block">
                    install.packages("tidyverse") <br>
                    library(tidyverse)
                </div>
                <p> Once you have installed the tidyverse package, you can use the functions in the package to manipulate data. </p>

            <h2> How to manipulate data </h2>
           <h3> Data classes </h3> 
           <p> In the last lesson we learned multiple data classes, such as vectors, briefly.</p>
              <p> In R, there are several data types that you will encounter when working with data. Some of the most common data types include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Vectors: A vector is a one-dimensional array that can hold numeric, character, or logical data. </li>
                    <li> Matrices: A matrix is a two-dimensional array that can hold numeric, character, or logical data. </li>
                    <li> Data frames: A data frame is a two-dimensional array that can hold numeric, character, or logical data. </li>
                    <li> Lists: A list is a collection of objects that can hold numeric, character, or logical data. </li>
                </ul>
                <p> In R, you can use the str() function to determine the data type of an object. </p>
                <p> For example, if you have a data frame, you can use the following code to determine the data type of the object. We will use the Iris dataset for shared shared standard dataset: </p>
                <div class = "code-block">
                    class(iris) <br>
                    # [1] "data.frame"
                    </div>
                    <p> In this example, the class() function returns "data.frame", which indicates that the object is a data frame. </p>
                    <p>We can index this dataframe with the methods discussed last lesson,
                        but we can also use the dplyr package to manipulate the data. </p>
                        <p> For example, you can use the filter() function to filter rows based on a condition and select() which selects a column. </p>
                        <p> Let's see what this looks like in code</p>
                        <div class = "code-block">
                            iris %>%<br> 
                            filter(Species == "setosa") %>%<br>
                             select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width) %>%<br>
                                head()
                        </div>
                        This code takes iris, filters the rows where the species is setosa, selects the Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width columns, and then displays the first few rows of the resulting data frame. </p>
                        <p> %>% is the "pipe" function, which pipes the object preceding into the first argument of the following function. An alternative pipe is |> </p>
                        <p> an example of pipe</p>
                        <div class = "code-block">
                            2 %>%<br>
                            sqrt()<br>
                            $ [1] 1.414214
                        </div>
                        <p> This code takes 2, pipes it into the sqrt() function, and then returns the square root of 2. </p>
                        <p> This is a basic example of data manipulation in R. There are many other functions that you can use to manipulate data, and I encourage you to explore the dplyr and tidyr packages to learn more. </p>
                        <p> Another important function is mutate().
                            mutate() allows you to create new columns based on existing columns. </p>
                            <p> For example, you can use the following code to create a new column called "Petal.Ratio" that is the ratio of Petal.Length to Petal.Width: </p>
                            <div class = "code-block">
                                iris %>%<br>
                                mutate(Petal.Ratio = Petal.Length / Petal.Width) %>%<br>
                                head()
                            </div>
                            <p> This code creates a new column called "Petal.Ratio" that is the ratio of Petal.Length to Petal.Width and then displays the first few rows of the resulting data frame. </p>
                            <h2> Split-Apply-Combine</h2>
                            <p> The split-apply-combine strategy is a common data manipulation strategy that involves splitting the data into groups, applying a function to each group, and then combining the results. </p>
                            <p> In R, you can use the group_by() and summarize() functions to implement the split-apply-combine strategy. </p>
                            <p> For example, you can use the following code to calculate the mean Sepal.Length for each species in the Iris dataset: </p>
                            <div class = "code-block">
                                iris %>%<br>
                                group_by(Species) %>%<br>
                                summarize(mean(Sepal.Length))
                            </div>
                            <p> This code groups the data by the Species column, calculates the mean Sepal.Length for each group, and then displays the results. </p>
                            <p> This is a basic example of the split-apply-combine strategy in R. There are many other functions that you can use to implement this strategy, and I encourage you to explore the dplyr and tidyr packages to learn more. </p>
                            <h2> Pivot_longer</h2>
                            <p> The pivot_longer() function is a useful function for reshaping data from wide to long format, which long format makes analysis very easy. </p>
                            <p> For example, you can use the following code to reshape the Iris dataset from wide to long format: </p>
                            <div class = "code-block">
                                iris %>%<br>
                                pivot_longer(cols = c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width), names_to = "Measurement", values_to = "Value") %>%<br>
                                head()
                            </div>
                            <p> This code reshapes the Iris dataset from wide to long format, where the columns Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, and Petal.Width are reshaped into two columns: Measurement and Value. </p>
                            <p> This shape enables you to group by the measurement type, which could be useful for building relationships
                                between the variables. </p>
                            </p>
                            <p> This is a basic example of reshaping data in R. There are many other functions that you can use to reshape data, and I encourage you to explore the tidyr package to learn more. </p>

                            <h2> Conclusion</h2>
                            <p> In this lesson, we learned what data manipulation is, why it is important, and how to manipulate data in R. We also learned about the split-apply-combine strategy and the pivot_longer() function. </p>
